## Recipe Guide for Tidying Business Data in R 

Data is the backbone of any machine learning project. However, data is rarely in the format that is required for machine learning algorithms. Data must be transformed, cleaned, and manipulated to achieve the desired results. This process is known as data cleaning, or data wrangling. Data cleaning is an essential step in the machine learning pipeline. Through examples, we will discuss how to tidy data in R for machine learning in business.

R is a powerful tool for data cleaning and manipulation. The tidyverse is a collection of R packages that make data cleaning and manipulation easy and efficient. In this chapter, we will use the tidyverse packages to tidy data for machine learning in business.

### 1: Understanding Tidy Data

Tidy data is a standard format for data that facilitates analysis and manipulation. Tidy data has the following characteristics:

Each variable has its column.
Each observation has its row.
Each value has its cell.
When data is tidy, it is easy to filter, sort, and group data. Tidy data is also easy to visualize, which is important in exploratory data analysis.

### 2: Importing Data into R

Before we can tidy data in R, we must first import it. R can import data from various file formats, including CSV, Excel, and SQL. In this section, we will use the readr package to import data from a CSV file.

### 3: Cleaning Data

Cleaning data involves removing missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting data types. In this section, we will use the dplyr package to clean data.

### 4: Reshaping Data

Reshaping data involves transforming data from a wide format to a long format, or vice versa. In this section, we will use the tidyr package to reshape data.

### 5: Joining Data

Joining data involves combining data from different tables based on common columns. In this section, we will use the dplyr package to join data.

### 6: Conclusion

Tidying data in R is an essential step in the machine learning pipeline. The tidyverse packages make data cleaning and manipulation easy and efficient. We we will demonstrate exploratory data analysis and how to tidy data for machine learning in business using R. We will explore different methods of importing data, cleaning data, reshaping data, and joining data.
